**go-pipedrive** is a Rest API for [Pipedrive.com](http://pipedrive.com). You can manage
your application with this library. It contains multiple
API V1 requests Pipedrive provides with support of CRUD operations.

## Quick Start / Installation

To get started with **go-pipedrive**, you'll need to do the following:

- Install the latest version of Go.

## Models

**go-pipedrive** includes a package for working with models, which allows you to use just the API and **create your own models**.
This means you can create your own structs and use them with our **go-pipedrive** package,
even if you don't want to use every field from Pipedrive's entities.

Here's the link to [Models](https://github.com/whatcrm/go-pipedrive/models) package and example of how to install the package.
